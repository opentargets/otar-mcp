Execute the same GraphQL query multiple times with different variable sets.

Use this tool instead of the regular query tool when you need to run the same query
repeatedly with different arguments (e.g., querying multiple drugs, targets, or diseases).

WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:

Step 1: RESOLVE IDENTIFIERS
    If user provides common names (gene symbols, disease names, drug names),
    use `search_entity` tool FIRST to convert them to standardized IDs:

    - Targets/Genes: "BRCA1", "BRCA2" -> ENSEMBL IDs "ENSG00000012048", "ENSG00000139618"
    - Diseases: "breast cancer" -> EFO/MONDO ID "MONDO_0007254"
    - Drugs: "aspirin", "ibuprofen" -> ChEMBL IDs "CHEMBL1201583", "CHEMBL521"
    - Variants: Use "chr_pos_ref_alt" format or rsIDs

    Example: search_entity(query_string="BRCA1 BRCA2", entity_names=["target"])

Step 2: LEARN QUERY STRUCTURE
    Call `get_open_targets_graphql_schema` with relevant categories to retrieve
    the schema subset needed for your query. Select categories that cover the
    data domains you need - BE INCLUSIVE (it's better to include extra categories
    than to miss required types).

    Example: For a query about drug mechanisms and safety:
    get_open_targets_graphql_schema(categories=["drug-mechanisms", "drug-safety"])

    Study the returned schema to understand available types, fields, and their
    relationships, then construct a GraphQL query that fetches the information
    the user needs.

    FALLBACK: If you encounter errors or need detailed information about specific
    types, use `get_type_dependencies` sparingly to explore type relationships.
    This tool provides exhaustive type dependency information but should only be
    used when category-based retrieval is insufficient.

Step 3: CONSTRUCT AND EXECUTE BATCH QUERY
    Build GraphQL query and variables_list using:
    - Standardized IDs from Step 1 (REQUIRED)
    - Query patterns from Step 2
    - Follow the "COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID" guidance in the schema output

    Call this tool with query_string, variables_list, and key_field.

REQUIRED IDENTIFIER FORMATS:
- Targets/Genes: ENSEMBL IDs (e.g., "ENSG00000139618")
- Diseases: EFO IDs (e.g., "EFO_0000305") or MONDO IDs (e.g., "MONDO_0007254")
- Drugs: ChEMBL IDs (e.g., "CHEMBL1201583")
- Variants: "chr_pos_ref_alt" format (e.g., "19_44908822_C_T") or rsIDs (e.g., "rs7412")
- Studies: Study IDs (e.g., "GCST90002357")
- Credible Sets: Study Locus IDs (e.g., "7d68cc9c70351c9dbd2a2c0c145e555d")
